## Installation
In order to successfully use this project, the user must have Node.js installed on their machine.  This will give the user access to a number of Node's modules, most importantly 'file system' and 'express'.  Before installing inquirer, the user should create a 'package.json' file in their root directory by typing 'npm init' in the command line terminal. Also, the user should create a .gitignore file in their root directory and add at least 'node_modules' and '.DS_Store' to the file.  Then, the user should install express.js to their project by typing 'npm install express' in the command line terminal.  Also, in order to use the test files, the user should install Jest to their project by typing 'npm install jest' in the command line terminal.  This will add both express and jest as a dependencies within the 'package.json' file, create a 'package-lock.json file', and create the ignored 'node_modules' folder.  If installing jest, you should navigate to the 'package.json' file and ensure that the property of 'test' within the 'scripts' object is set to 'jest'.
